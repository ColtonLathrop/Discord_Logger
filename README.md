# Discord_Logger
Simple custom Discord Gateway integration to log to SQL database.

If anything, it's a good example of how to format the requests on the gateway and handle authentication.

Always on - <%0.5 cpu usage with <15 mb memory usage.

Logs Presence updates and messages to all channels

Very simple - with horrible Async logic.
